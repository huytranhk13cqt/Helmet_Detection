# Helmet_Detection
This is an Object Detection app built with Streamlit, OpenCV, and the YOLOv10 model. The app allows users to upload an image, choose a pre-trained model, and adjust parameters such as confidence threshold and image size for detection. The processed image with detected objects will be displayed and can be downloaded.
